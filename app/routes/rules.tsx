### üöÄ Qualification
All players must submit two qualifying scores by **November 10, 2023, 11:59pm EST**.

There are eight qualifying songs in total. Players will receive a rating based on Pump It Up Phoenix's rating system for both song played. The achieved rating of the two songs chosen will be added together and used for seeding. The top 10 seeds will be seeded into the Pro Bracket while all other seeds will be seeded into the Gauntlet.

Players will be allowed to submit scores from either an XX cab or a Phoenix cab. Scores from Pump It Up XX will be converted as accurately as possible to Phoenix's score system. Please note that the organizers are not responsible for any mistypes into the qualifier submission form that may affect seeding.

#### Qualification Chart Pool

- **S10**: District 1
- **S12**: Black Swan
- **S14**: Heart Rabbit Coaster
- **S16**: A Site De La Rue
- **S18**: Nihilism -Another Ver.-
- **S20**: Sarabande 
- **S22**: Skeptic
- **D24**: Achluoias

#### Qualifier Scoring

Qualifying rating will be calculated using the Phoenix rating system. Scores lower than the Phoenix equivalent of 900,000 points (AA) will be given a rating of 0 for that qualifying score. Failing a song does not matter. Players with a total qualifier score of 0 will not be counted as qualified.

#### Qualifier Tiebreakers
Tiebreakers will be broken by the total score of the two qualifying charts submitted. Second tiebreaker will be the earliest score submission.

Photos are required with every score submission. Rules for photo submissions:
1. Modifiers must be clearly visible (Normal judgment must be used)
1. Score must be legible
1. Song must be identifiable from image
1. Your username must be visible

**Failure to submit qualifiers by the deadline could result in disqualification from the tournament.**

#### Waterfall
Players will be seeded into a pool based on their qualifier scores. Four songs will be played each round. Players will then be awarded points based on their score on each song in comparison to other players in the pool.

At the end of each pool, the total amount of points per player will be summed. The two players with the amount of highest points in the pool will move onto the next pool. All other players are eliminated.

- 4th place: 1 point

**Procedure**
1. 8 songs will be randomly drawn from the pool difficulty range
1. Players will ban one song starting from lowest seed to highest seed until four remain
1. The top 2 seeds play first followed by the remaining bottom 2 seeds
1. Repeat step 2 - 3 until all four songs are played 

**Tiebreaker**

In the case a tiebraeker is needed, one random song will be drawn with the same difficulty settings as the current pool. The player with the higher score wins. This can be repeated until the tie is broken.

#### Promotion Pool

#### Card Draw
GUAC 7 introduces new rules to reduce the amount of duplicate songs and add more strategy into the tournament

- The number of bans will be reduced to prevent players from favoring the same songs across tournaments
- Competitors all start with two re-draws that can be used throughout the bracket
  - Re-draws allow competitors to choose any song in the draw and re-randomize it after initial bans are complete
  - A player can re-draw up to twice in a single match
  - Players can only hold up to a maximum of two re-draws at any time
  - Players who reach the following stages will receive an additional re-draw
    - Winner's Semis
    - Loser's Quarters
    - Loser's Finals
    - Grand Finals
- For each round in the tournament, the song pool will be split evenly based on the number of matches in the round
  - This ensures that all songs across each match in a round are unique
  - With the exception: Loser's Finals and Winner's Finals are grouped together as one round
  - Splits per Round
    - Winner's R1: 4
    - Winner's Quarters: 4
    - Loser's R1: 4
    - Loser's R2: 2
    - Winner's Semis: 2
    - Loser's Quarters: 2
    - Loser's Semis: 1 (no split)
    - Loser's Finals/Winner's Finals: 2 (split between the two matches)
    - Grand Finals: 1 (no split)
